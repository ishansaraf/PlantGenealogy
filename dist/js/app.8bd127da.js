These limonene terpenes are juxtaposed against earthy, floral undertones that also speak to the strain’s strong OG background.      ",parents:["hybrid:tahoe-hydro-og","indica:granddaddy-purple"],Aroused:"0.0",Creative:"0.0",Energetic:"0.0",Euphoric:"0.0",Focused:"0.0",Giggly:"0.0",Happy:"0.0",Hungry:"0.0",Relaxed:"0.0",Sleepy:"0.0",Talkative:"0.0",Tingly:"0.0",Uplifted:"0.0",Apple:"0.0",Apricot:"0.0",Berry:"0.0","Blue Cheese":"0.0",Blueberry:"0.0",Butter:"0.0",Cheese:"0.0",Chemical:"0.0",Chestnut:"0.0",Citrus:"1.0",Coffee:"0.0",Diesel:"0.0",Earthy:"1.0",Flowery:"0.0",Grape:"0.0",Grapefruit:"0.0",Honey:"0.0",Lavender:"0.0",Lemon:"0.0",Lime:"0.0",Mango:"0.0",Menthol:"0.0",Mint:"0.0",Nutty:"0.0",Orange:"0.0",Peach:"0.0",Pear:"0.0",Pepper:"0.0",Pine:"0.0",Pineapple:"0.0",Plum:"0.0",Pungent:"0.0",Rose:"0.0",Sage:"0.0",Skunk:"0.0","Spicy/Herbal":"0.0",Strawberry:"0.0",Sweet:"0.0",Tar:"0.0",Tea:"0.0",Tobacco:"0.0",Tree:"0.0",Fruit:"0.0",Tropical:"0.0",Vanilla:"0.0",Violet:"0.0",Woody:"1.0",Inflammation:"0.0",Nausea:"0.0",Pain:"0.0",Depression:"0.0",Insomnia:"0.0","Lack of Appetite":"0.0",Cramps:"0.0",Seizures:"0.0","Muscle Spasms":"0.0",Headaches:"0.0",Fatigue:"0.0","Eye Pressure":"0.0",Spasticity:"0.0",Paranoid:"0.0",Anxious:"100.0","Dry Eyes":"0.0","Dry Mouth":"100.0",Headache:"0.0",Stress:"0.0","avg rating":"4.25","num ratings":"4.0",id:"indica:tahoe-purps"}},{id:"sativa:haze-wreck",name:"Haze Wreck",group:1,data:{name:"Haze Wreck",description:"You could call Haze Wreck the “perfect storm” of sativas, as it unites the lineages of two legendary strains, Haze and Trainwreck.

As the name suggests, this flower reeks of burnt sugar, doughy earth, and tropical flora. The flavor is as sweet and caramel as the aroma, but with spicy notes of hash on the finish. Caramel Kona Coffee Cookies was created by crossing Pua Mana’s Caramel Kona Coffee Kush and Herban Tribe’s GSC Forum Cut. This Kush-heavy combination hits the body like an avalanche, leveling stress and worry to the ground. As this intense physical sensation dissipates, it is replaced by mental and physical elation that elevates the mood, making it ideal for social gatherings or dark winter nights.  ",parents:["indica:caramel-kona-coffee-kush","hybrid:gsc"],Aroused:"0.0",Creative:"0.0",Energetic:"0.0",Euphoric:"0.0",Focused:"0.0",Giggly:"0.0",Happy:"0.0",Hungry:"0.0",Relaxed:"0.0",Sleepy:"0.0",Talkative:"0.0",Tingly:"0.0",Uplifted:"0.0",Apple:"0.0",Apricot:"0.0",Berry:"0.0","Blue Cheese":"0.0",Blueberry:"0.0",Butter:"0.0",Cheese:"0.0",Chemical:"0.0",Chestnut:"0.0",Citrus:"0.0",Coffee:"0.0",Diesel:"0.0",Earthy:"0.0",Flowery:"0.0",Grape:"0.0",Grapefruit:"0.0",Honey:"0.0",Lavender:"0.0",Lemon:"0.0",Lime:"0.0",Mango:"0.0",Menthol:"0.0",Mint:"0.0",Nutty:"0.0",Orange:"0.0",Peach:"0.0",Pear:"0.0",Pepper:"0.0",Pine:"0.0",Pineapple:"0.0",Plum:"0.0",Pungent:"0.0",Rose:"0.0",Sage:"0.0",Skunk:"0.0","Spicy/Herbal":"0.0",Strawberry:"0.0",Sweet:"0.0",Tar:"0.0",Tea:"0.0",Tobacco:"0.0",Tree:"0.0",Fruit:"0.0",Tropical:"0.0",Vanilla:"0.0",Violet:"0.0",Woody:"0.0",Inflammation:"0.0",Nausea:"0.0",Pain:"0.0",Depression:"0.0",Insomnia:"0.0","Lack of Appetite":"0.0",Cramps:"0.0",Seizures:"0.0","Muscle Spasms":"0.0",Headaches:"0.0",Fatigue:"0.0","Eye Pressure":"0.0",Spasticity:"0.0",Paranoid:"0.0",Anxious:"0.0","Dry Eyes":"100.0","Dry Mouth":"100.0",Headache:"0.0",Stress:"0.0","avg rating":"5.0","num ratings":"2.0",id:"hybrid:caramel-kona-coffee-cookies"}},{id:"indica:white-kush",name:"White Kush",group:3,data:{name:"White Kush",description:"White Kush is the dreamy daughter of Afghan Kush and White Widow.

Some varieties of Island Sweet Skunk have a heightened CBD content to help patients treating anxiety, inflammation, and muscle spasms. Flowering occurs at 7 to 8 weeks, and buds will have bright yellow-orange hairs. ",parents:["hybrid:skunk-1"],Aroused:"0.0",Creative:"0.0",Energetic:"0.0",Euphoric:"0.0",Focused:"0.0",Giggly:"0.0",Happy:"0.0",Hungry:"0.0",Relaxed:"0.0",Sleepy:"0.0",Talkative:"0.0",Tingly:"0.0",Uplifted:"0.0",Apple:"0.0",Apricot:"0.0",Berry:"0.0","Blue Cheese":"0.0",Blueberry:"0.0",Butter:"0.0",Cheese:"0.0",Chemical:"0.0",Chestnut:"0.0",Citrus:"0.0",Coffee:"0.0",Diesel:"0.0",Earthy:"0.0",Flowery:"0.0",Grape:"0.0",Grapefruit:"0.0",Honey:"0.0",Lavender:"0.0",Lemon:"0.0",Lime:"0.0",Mango:"0.0",Menthol:"0.0",Mint:"0.0",Nutty:"0.0",Orange:"0.0",Peach:"0.0",Pear:"0.0",Pepper:"0.0",Pine:"0.0",Pineapple:"0.0",Plum:"0.0",Pungent:"0.0",Rose:"0.0",Sage:"0.0",Skunk:"1.0","Spicy/Herbal":"0.0",Strawberry:"0.0",Sweet:"1.0",Tar:"0.0",Tea:"0.0",Tobacco:"0.0",Tree:"0.0",Fruit:"0.0",Tropical:"1.0",Vanilla:"0.0",Violet:"0.0",Woody:"0.0",Inflammation:"0.0",Nausea:"0.0",Pain:"0.0",Depression:"0.0",Insomnia:"0.0","Lack of Appetite":"0.0",Cramps:"0.0",Seizures:"0.0","Muscle Spasms":"0.0",Headaches:"0.0",Fatigue:"0.0","Eye Pressure":"0.0",Spasticity:"0.0",Paranoid:"29.81",Anxious:"47.85","Dry Eyes":"53.41","Dry Mouth":"100.0",Headache:"0.0",Stress:"0.0","avg rating":"4.2993288590604","num ratings":"764.0",id:"sativa:island-sweet-skunk"}},{id:"hybrid:blue-velvet",name:"Blue Velvet",group:2,data:{name:"Blue Velvet",description:"Blue Velvet, also known as Blueberry Thai, is a 50/50 hybrid strain that is named for the lush appearance of its plants.
